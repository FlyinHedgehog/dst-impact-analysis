# Analysis on Türkiye's Decision to Repeal Daylight Saving Time
This study aims to provide a comprehensive overview of Türkiye’s decision to abolish the Daylight Saving Time policy and remain on permanent DST.

## Overview
In this study, I will conduct a comprehensive analysis of Türkiye's decision to adopt Daylight Saving Time (DST) as the permanent time zone. The aim is to analyze recent data to assess the claimed benefits and disadvantages of Daylight Saving Time.

The study will consist of two parts. Firstly, I will discuss whether Türkiye’s decision to adopt a permanent time zone is favorable. To achieve this, the study will first synthesize insights from prior research, providing a solid perspective on the controversies and effects associated with DST. Secondly, I will question whether adopting permanent DST rather than permanent Standard Time was a better choice or not.

Subsequently, the research will extend its scope by offering practical guidance for countries contemplating the abolition of DST.
